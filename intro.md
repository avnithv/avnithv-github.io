# What is a computer program?
A computer program is a set of instructions for a computer to execute to complete a task. Computer programs make it possible for the computer to communicate with the user and perform a task. A program consists of many simple operations, which can be done very fast.
## Programming Languages
Programming languages allow people to write instructions for a computer. They are human-readable programs which are then translated into machine code. The code that the computer actually runs is in machine language and is unreadable to humans.

There are two types of programming languages: **compiled** and **interpreted**. Compiled programs are translated into machine languages before being executed. This makes the program very fast during runtime, or when it is run, but compiling can take up a lot of time since you may be compiling multiple times. Interpreted programs are translated when they are run, which eliminates the need to compile and makes it easier to revise your program. The downside is that it is not very fast because it is translated at runtime.

### Some programming languages:
**Java** is one programming language. It is relatively easy to learn and has many useful features. It is a compiled language, so it is very fast. It has a lot of features and functions and has many applications.

**C++** is another programming language. It is one of the fastest because it is compiled. However, it is also complicated and not very easy to learn. It also has a lot of features that give it a lot of applications.

**Python** is a programming language. It is one of the easiest to learn, read, and program in. It is an interpreted language, which makes it faster to change and check your program, but is not very fast. There are different versions of Python, but the current most popular one is Python 3.

# How to use IDE - Repl

You can use an IDE such as repl.it to write code. To use Repl, you first need a google account or a GitHub account. If you have a GitHub account, you can easily upload your code to GitHub and share it with others. Even if you donâ€™t have an account, you can still write and test your code easily there. 

## How to run a program in Repl

* Go to your dashboard. 
* Click new repl. 
* Choose Python as your language. 
* Write the name of the repl. 
* Click create repl. 
* In the top left, you can add or remove programs in your repl. 
* To run a program, click on it in the list on the left and then click the green run button on the top.
