# What is a computer program?
A computer program is a set of instructions for a computer that it executes to complete a task. Computers can complete basic operations very quickly, so most simple computer programs can be executed in less than a second.  Computer programs allow computers to communicate with users, perform tasks, and be useful. Computer programs are written in machine code, which is just 0s and 1s, and are unreadable to humans. 

## Programming Languages
Programming languages allow people to write instructions for a computer. They are different from computer programs because they are human-readable and are translated into machine code to run. The code that the computer actually runs is the computer program, but it is impossible for a human to read it or write in it.

There are two types of programming languages: **compiled** and **interpreted**. Compiled programs are translated into machine languages before being executed. This makes the program very fast during runtime, or when it is run. However, compiling can take up a lot of time since you will be compiling each time you change the program. Interpreted programs are translated when they are run, which eliminates the need to compile and makes it easier to revise your program. The downside is that it isn't very fast because of the translation during runtime.

## Some programming languages:
**Java** is a popular programming language. It is a compiled language, so it is very fast. It is relatively easy to learn and has many useful features, functions and applications.

**C++** is one of the most used programming language. It is also one of the fastest because it is compiled. However, it can be complicated and difficult to learn. It also has a lot of features that give it a lot of applications.

**Python** is another popular programming language. It is one of the easiest to learn, read, and use. It is an interpreted language, which makes it faster to change and check your program, but is not very fast. There are different versions of Python, but the current one used is Python 3.

# How to use IDE - Repl

You can use an IDE such as Repl to write and store code. To use Repl, you first need a google account or a GitHub account. If you have a GitHub account, you can easily upload your code to GitHub and share it with others. Even if you donâ€™t have a GitHub account, you can still write and test your code easily there with a google account. 

## How to run a program in Repl

* Login to Repl
* Go to your homepage. 
* Click new repl at the top left of your screen. 
* Choose Python as your language. 
* Write the name of the repl. 
* Click create repl. 
* In the top left, click the add file button and name the file .replit
* In the file copy this code:
```
run = 'python3 main.py'
```
* To add more programs, click the add file button and name the program, making sure that it ends with a .py
* To run a program, go to the .replit file and add the program name instead of main.py
* Then, click on the program in the list on the top left and click run at the top of the screen
