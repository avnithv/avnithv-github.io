# Mutable vs. Immutable
There are two types of datatypes: mutable, and immutable. These determine what properties the datatype may have and how you can manipulate it. 

What is the difference? 

The short answer is that mutable data is changeable while immutable data is not. The actual reason why is because of how the data is stored by the computer. Data is assigned to an ID which corresponds to a place in the computer's memory. Immutable data is assigned an ID that changes after each operation. In other words, it is assigned an new place in the memory each time it is changed. This means you have to assign it to a new variable or reassign it to the same variable after each operation. Mutable datatypes are always stored in the same spot in the memory and the same variable. After an operation, the changes are made to the data itself, and there is no need to reassign it. 

It is important to know which datatypes are immutable and which are mutable. Ints, floats, strings, and boolean data are all immutable. Lists and Dictionaries, which we will learn about in this chapter, are mutable.

# Lists

## What are lists?
Lists are ways to store a lot of data in one variable. They are an ordered and mutable sequence of values. These values can be any data; ints, floats, strings, boolean, even other lists. Lists are similar to strings in the way that they are stored. Lists are stored as a sequence of individual values, not as a whole, like strings are stored as a sequence of characters and not one whole string. Each item inside of a list is accessed the same way as strings, starting from zero and increasing moving right, or starting at -1 and decreasing moving left. The only difference is that list can contain any item, while strings can only contain single characters. Also, lists are mutable while strings are not.

Lists are defined by a pair of square brackets around it with each item inside separated by a comma, similar to string being defined by a pair of quotes around it.

## Creating and Changing Lists
There are three main ways to create lists:
- `list(iterable)` constructor: Changes a string into a list of characters or any number of arguments into a list. **Example:** `list('Hello')` gives `['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']` and `list(1, 2, 3)` gives `[1, 2, 3]`
- Directly with `[]` and`,`: Like other datatypes we have previously learned, lists can be directly assigned to a variable. You have to use the form discussed with square brackets and commas
- Using the `split(string)` method: Splits a string into a list of substrings that do not overlap whenever a substring appears. For example, splitting a sentence with the substring `' '`, which is the default value, will return a list of words because each word is separated by a space.

The two most common ways that lists are created in practice are the second and third ways. The second is for lists made by the progammer and the third is more for processing the input into a list.

There are two ways to add items to a list:
- `list.append(item)` method: Adds an item to the back of a list
- `list.insert(index, item) method: Adds item into list such that the item is in the `index`th index.

Append is used more because you want to add an item to the end of a list most of the time. Insert is used less.

There are two ways to remove items from a list:
- `del list[start:stop:step]` with **del** keyword: Removes item at an index or all items in a slice.
- `list.pop(index)` method: Remove item at index as well as returning its value.

## Operations with lists
Here are some of the most common operations with lists:
- Slice - `list[start:stop:step]` - Similar to strings, it returns a sublist starting with the item at index `start` ending with the item before the one at `stop`, and by every `step` items.
- Change an item's value - `list[index] = new_value` - Directly changes an item's value
- Sort the list - `list.sort()` - Sorts the list into ascending order. Works only with ints, floats, and strings, and orders string based on **ASCII** values.
- Reverse the list order - `list.reverse() ` - Reverses the order of the list so that the last item is now first, and vice versa.
- Find length of list - `len(list)` - Returns the length of the list
- Find if item is in list - `if item in list` - **if** and **in** are keywords, and this returns `True` if the item is in the list.
- Find how many times an item appears in a list - `list.count(item)` - Returns the number of times an item appears in a list.

In a list of all ints or floats:
- Find sum of all items in list - `sum(list)` - Returns the sum of all items in list
- Find maximum/minimum of the items in the list - `max(list)`/`min(list)` - Returns the maximum/minimum item in list.

# Dictionaries

## What are dictionaries?
Dictionaries are an unordered and mutable set of key-value pairs such that each key is unique and corresponds to a value. A set is a group that is unordered unless stated otherwise in certain cases. Each item in the dictionary is in the form of a pair of values, one being the key and the other being the value. Each key is used to access its value. Because of this, each key must be unique to the other keys, but values do not need to be unique. The keys and values can be any data with one exception: the key may not be a list or a dictionary. This is because lists and dictionaries are mutable. Since they are unordered, dictionaries do not have indexes and cannot be sliced. Dictionaries are defined with items being in the form `key : value`, each item separated by a comma, and curly brackets surrounding the qhole thing.

## Creating and Changing Dictionaries
There are two ways of creating a dictionary:
- Directly through `{}`, `,`, and `key : value`: Assigns the dictionary to a variable with the key-value pairs specified already inside.
- Using `dict(key = value)` constructor: The must be a string and is written without quotes. Returns a dictionary with each key-value pair specified.

The first way is used more often in practice because it is simpler.

There are again two main ways of adding key-value pairs to a dictionary
- Directly adding it through `dict[key] = value`: Directly adds the key-value pair, best if you are adding only a few pairs.
- Using `dict.update(new_dict)` method: Adds to or overwrites the key-value pairs currently in the dictionary with the key-value pairs in another dictionary.

The first method is used more but the second is used as well in certain cases.

There are two ways of removing key-value pairs which are the same as in lists:
- `del dict[key]` with **del** keyword: Removes a key-value pair with the specified key
- `dict.pop(key)` method: Remove key-value pair with specified key as well as returning its value.

Both ways are commonly used in practice.

## Operations with dictionaries
Here are some common operations with dictionaries:
- Access value at key - `dict[key]` - Gives the value which the key corresponds to
- Find all keys/values/pairs - `dict.keys()`/`dict.values()`/`dict.items()` - Returns a list of the dictionary's keys/values/pairs in the form `[key, pair]`
- Pop last inserted pair - `dict.popitem(key)` - Returns pair last inserted in the form `[key, value]`
- Return value if key exists otherwise set key to value - `dict.setdefault(key, value)` - Returns value key corresponds to; if it doesnt exist, adds new pair `key : value`

The last two operations are not used commonly. Dictionaries as a whole are less used than lists, which are a simpler and more applicable version of a dictionary.
