# Practice Problem - Bridge

## Overview
- Bridge is a card game played by 2 pairs of people, or 4 people. 
- Each player recieves 13 cards.
- The pairs who are partners can only communicate through verbal bids.
- These bids tell both partners the strength of the hand of cards they have.
- The point is to communicate until it is found that both partners are strong in one suit.
- Instead of saying ‘I have at least 5 hearts and at least 13 points.”, a partner would bid 'One heart'
- Points are scored by 4 points for each ace, 3 for each king, 2 for each queen and 1 for each jack. 
- The suits are ranked from highest to lowest as Spades(S), Hearts(H), Diamonds(D), and Clubs(C).

## Bidding rules:
- First bidder must have at least 13 points. They bid one of the suit with the highest number of cards that is at least 5 for S and H and 3 for D and C.
- If there is a tie in the number of cards, they bid the one with the highest suit
- If the player does not have 13, they bid PASS

## Input
- Five lines of input
- Each line has four strings separated by a comma and a space
- Each string is the cards the player has for each suit in the order S, H, D, and C
- The string contains the characters `'A'` (ace), `'K'` (king), `'Q'` (queen),`'J'` (jack), or `'x'` (any other card), which represents the cards of that suit.

## Output
- For each line, print the number of points the player has as well as their bid, separated by a comma and a space
- Both must be correct to score one point for the line

AKxx, Qxx, AJxxx, J
AKxxx, Qxx, AJxx, J
